            Many small or big restaurants specializing in Newari food offer tasty Baras at reasonable prices.
            It is golden brown in color and could also be made by mixing other ingredients like meat and egg
            in it which are known as Masu-Bara and Anda-Bara, respectively. However, Bara is a vegetarian dish
            unless mixed with egg or meat.

                Beyond just a snack, bara hold significance to the Newari people. On special occasions,
                they are given as part of a good-luck set of food, called sagun, which also might include
                chiura, fried boiled eggs, yomari, and a variety of curries. Nicely crisp on the outside and
                fluffy in the middle, bara are best eaten hot.
