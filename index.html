        Momo is made from wheat flour, vegetable oil, chopped onion, garlic, sesame, green chilies,
        tomatoes, meat (buff), mustard powder, ginger juice and a blend of Nepalese herbal spices.
        First, pour water into the wheat flour and knead the resulting dough into a smooth paste.
        Then mold into small, thin discs.

        There are typically two types of momo, steamed and fried. Momo is usually served with a dipping sauce
        (locally called chutney/achhar), normally made with tomato as the base ingredient. 
        Soup momo is a dish with steamed momo immersed in a meat or vegetable broth. Pan-fried momo is also
        known as kothey momo. Steamed momo served in hot sauce is called C-momo. There are also a variety of
        dumplings of Nepal found in the Indian state of Sikkim and Darjeeling district, including tingmo and thaipo.
