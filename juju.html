            Juju Dhau is a sweetened custard-like yogurt that is mostly centred at Kathmandu valley, Nepal,
            and is an important element of all feasts and celebrations specially in the Newar community. 
            In the Newari language Juju Dhau literally means "king of yoghurt". While cow's milk is used to
            make regular yoghurt. The richer taste and texture of juju dhau is the result of using fresh buffalo milk.

            The texture and taste of Juju Dhau is which makes it adorable. It is prepared in a traditional
            clay pot which is known as kataura. The clay pot helps in the loss of moisture and gives a firm 
            texture to it. Instead of sugar, spices like, coconuts, cardamom, etc are added to it to create
            mouth-melting sweetness. Like other yoghurt, Juju Dhau is also created by bacterial fermentation,
            which is a metabolic process that changes sugar into acids, liquor and gasses. It happens in yeast and in microorganisms.
