            Newa cuisine (also referred to as Newar cuisine) is a subset of Nepalese cuisine
            that has developed over centuries among the Newars of Kathmandu
            (Kathmandu is called Yen in Nepal bhasa language), Nepal. 
            Newa cuisine is the most celebrated food variety in the country that consists of over
            200 dishes. It is more elaborate than most Nepalese cuisines because the Kathmandu Valley 
            has exceptionally fertile alluvial soil and enough wealthy households to make growing produce
            more profitable than cultivating rice and other staples.
